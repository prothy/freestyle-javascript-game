# Flappy UFO game

This is a small game that we created to practice manipulating DOM elements, and we were restricted from using HTML canvas. Our intention was to make a copy of flappy bird, but using an UFO, and flying comets that replace the pipes.

We were a group of four and split up into pairs to create each game. If you wish to see what the other team worked on, see the development branch.
